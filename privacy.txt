Sober is an experimental software interoperability layer, which lets users run Roblox on Linux.

The data collected and the third parties involved differ depending on how you use our services.

* When you visit our website; when you install Sober using your package manager:
  Your device will connect to Cloudflare, as they're our CDN provider.
  Please see: https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/

* When you open the Sober app on your device:
   - We'll make a network request to Sober to check for updates, which also goes through Cloudflare.
     Please see: https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/
   - Of course, Sober will connect to Roblox services & open the Roblox app.
     Roblox has its own privacy policy, which can be found here:

* When you use the *optional* Automatic Downloads feature:
   - We'll make a network request to Sober to make Automatic Downloads work, which also goes through Cloudflare.
     Please see: https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/
   - The following anonymous information is sent along with this request & retained for analytics and error tracking:
       * Your current Sober version
       * The currently installed Roblox version (or none, if you've never installed Roblox before)
       * If the request failed, we'll send an error code explaining why the previous install failed
   - Your client will then receive a Google Play CDN download link, hosted by Google.
     We'll download the bundle from there.
     Google's privacy policy is here: https://policies.google.com/privacy

* When you use the *optional* server location indicator feature & visit an experience:
   - Sober has an optional feature to show you the location of the Roblox server you connected to.
   - To make it work, we'll connect to `ipinfo.io` and send the IP of the Roblox server you connected to.
   - This is optional, and we send the Roblox server IP, *NOT* your IP.
