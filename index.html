        <p>
            We're testing Sober, a brand new way to get Roblox on your Linux
            desktop. It's a novel approach, separate to other compatibility
            software like Wine, Android emulators, or virtual machines.
            Sober works by creating a specialized runtime just for Roblox's
            code, ensuring compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'd like to stress that <b>Sober is an experimental project</b>. It's
            a passion project rather than production-grade code. It's not supported by Roblox and may be discontinued at
            any time. You'll probably encounter bugs or instability.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can expect Sober's performance to be the same or better than
            the Windows client running natively on the same machine. Many users report performance that surpasses any
            official method of playing Roblox.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sober is unfortunately closed-source. This could change in the
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sober is a labor of love, and we'd love for you to try it out!
            We hope you enjoy your time.

            <h2 id="faq" class="h2">Frequently Questioned Answers</h2>

            <h4 id="how-does-sober-work" class="h4">How does Sober work?</h4>
            <p>Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port.</p>

            <h4 id="cant-see-bundle" class="h4">Why can't I see my application bundle in the file picker?</h4>
            <p>Your system doesn't have Desktop Portals properly configured. You can <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal">read documentation online</a> for information on how to fix this. Alternatively, you can download the Flatseal app and temporarily give Sober access to your Downloads directory.</p>

            <h4 id="why-is-it-crashing" class="h4">Why does Sober keep crashing?</h4>
            <p>Sober is experimental software, so expect crashes. To help us fix the issue, try to provide logs by running Sober from the terminal: <code>flatpak run org.vinegarhq.Sober</code></p>

            <h4 id="is-it-official" class="h4">Is Sober official? Will it get blocked by Roblox?</h4>
            <p>Sober is not affiliated with Roblox in any way. It's an unofficial community-made experimental project. Roblox may choose to prevent the Sober client from using their services.</p>
