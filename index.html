                <p>
                    A brand new way to get Roblox on your Linux
                    desktop. It's a novel approach, different from other compatibility
                    software like Wine, Android emulators, or virtual machines.
                    Sober works by creating a specialized runtime just for Roblox's
                    code, ensuring compatibility and performance.

                <h2>Blazingly fast</h2>
                <p>
                    You can expect Sober's performance to be the same or better than
                    the Windows client running natively on the same machine. Many users report performance that surpasses any
                    official method of playing Roblox.

                We'd like to stress that <b>Sober is an experimental project</b>. It's
                a passion project rather than production-grade code. It's not supported by Roblox and may be discontinued at
                any time. You'll probably encounter bugs or instability.

                Sober is unfortunately closed-source. This could change in the
                future.
