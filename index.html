                <p>
                    A brand new way to get Roblox on your Linux
                    desktop. It's a novel approach, different from other compatibility
                    software like Wine, Android emulators, or virtual machines.
                    Sober works by creating a specialized runtime just for Roblox's
                    code, ensuring compatibility and performance.

                <p>
                    You can expect Sober's performance to be the same or better than
                    the Windows client running natively on the same machine. Many users report performance that surpasses any
                    official method of playing Roblox.

                We'd like to stress that <b>Sober is an experimental project</b>. It's
                a passion project rather than production-grade code. It's not supported by Roblox and may be discontinued at
                any time. You'll probably encounter bugs or instability.

            <h3 id="how-does-sober-work" class="h4">How does Sober work?</h3>
            <p>Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port.</p>

            <h3 id="why-is-it-crashing" class="h4">Why does Sober keep crashing?</h3>
            <p>Sober is experimental software, so expect crashes. To help us fix the issue, try to provide logs by running Sober from the terminal: <code>flatpak run org.vinegarhq.Sober</code></p>

            <h3 id="is-it-official" class="h4">Is Sober official? Will it get blocked by Roblox?</h3>
            <p>Sober is not affiliated with Roblox in any way. It's an unofficial community-made experimental project. Roblox may choose to prevent the Sober client from using their services.</p>
